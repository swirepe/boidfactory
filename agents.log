2025-08-28T00:00:00Z write a program that generates new boids implementations
2025-08-28T00:00:00Z Repository Guidelines received (see AGENTS.md)
2025-08-28T00:05:00Z Can you please fix this error? ./boids-generator.py Traceback ... NameError: name 'this' is not defined.
2025-08-28T00:08:00Z I forgot to say - I want the simulations to also use a dark theme.
2025-08-28T00:12:00Z can you make another one just like agents/boids-multifile-generator.py but it makes them as single files instead?
2025-08-28T00:15:00Z extend ./boids-singlefile-generator.py to take a --count argument to make multiple simulations
2025-08-28T00:18:00Z I want a lot more variation in the simulations made by ./boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T00:25:00Z add more variation in click effect; add hidden config overlay with all configuration, include min speed, max force, and hue selector; make all configuration URL-overridable; update URL on change.
2025-08-28T00:33:00Z add a lot more variation, slick animations and patterns; ensure config changes apply immediately; polish config overlay; mobile friendly.
2025-08-28T00:40:00Z add perlin-routed drags, lissajous pulses tied to pointer velocity, and meteor strike gravity wells; add --index flag to boids-singlefile-generator.py to build viewer.
2025-08-28T00:45:00Z update singlefile generator <title> to descriptive per-variant title.
2025-08-28T00:50:00Z add a "rainbow" mode to template.html that cycles hue over time with controls and URL params.
2025-08-28T00:55:00Z display frame rate in singlefile simulations generated by agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:00:00Z look at runs/boids-20250827_233042_singlefile/boids-dod-quadtree-30-impl.html  Are there any optimizations you would make?
2025-08-28T01:05:00Z Update agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py with rendering and simulation optimizations (trail alpha via globalAlpha, cached trig, adaptive glow, tmp2 reuse, W/H alias, adaptive vision).
2025-08-28T01:08:00Z add the --index argument to agents/boids-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:10:00Z drift boid colors back toward base hue in agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:13:00Z add click/drag effects that temporarily affect per-boid alignment/cohesion/separation weights in agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py
==== 2025-08-28T04:07:49Z Prompt Start ====
there's a bug in show_help() in boidfactory.sh
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:18:41Z Prompt Start ====
Let's write a go program (multiple files, templates, etc) where as a command line program it behaves like agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py but it can also be a web server, where /{whatever} is a boids simulation seeded from the value {whatever}
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:25:07Z Prompt Start ====
I want parity with the python program.  Be better than it, if you can.  When serving a page, set the header to {whatever} and leave the subheader empty unless it is explicitly set
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:28:53Z Prompt Start ====
yes.  take as much as you can from the python program.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:52:09Z Prompt Start ====
Let's have the header be stylized a bit, and let's use a monospace font in more places.  Make sure "wrap" works and doesn't lose boids off the screen.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:59:44Z Prompt Start ====
yes please. also add a lot more variety to the simulations
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T05:24:17Z Prompt Start ====
add  as a shape for the boids, and add some variety in the size of the boids
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T05:24:20Z Prompt Start ====
add `ring` as a shape for the boids, and add some variety in the size of the boids
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T05:44:21Z Prompt Start ====
in the simulations generated by the go program, lets have a way to visualize the flow field.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T05:53:48Z Prompt Start ====
Let's add a way to toggle showing the header and subheader. When I click on an icon for an overlay that's already open, I'd like it to close. Add more configuration for the flow fields, including for non-uniform changes in the field. I bet we could make some really interesting patters with the flow fields.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T06:21:16Z Prompt Start ====
Make count slider change boid count live; add perception radius visualization (one/all); per-simulation variety in spawn and click/drag effects; enable flow viz when flow is on; add flow-glow based on nearest arrow; enable quadtree viz by default.
==== Prompt End ====
