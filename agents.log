2025-08-28T00:00:00Z write a program that generates new boids implementations
2025-08-28T00:00:00Z Repository Guidelines received (see AGENTS.md)
2025-08-28T00:05:00Z Can you please fix this error? ./boids-generator.py Traceback ... NameError: name 'this' is not defined.
2025-08-28T00:08:00Z I forgot to say - I want the simulations to also use a dark theme.
2025-08-28T00:12:00Z can you make another one just like agents/boids-multifile-generator.py but it makes them as single files instead?
2025-08-28T00:15:00Z extend ./boids-singlefile-generator.py to take a --count argument to make multiple simulations
2025-08-28T00:18:00Z I want a lot more variation in the simulations made by ./boids-singlefile-generator.py
