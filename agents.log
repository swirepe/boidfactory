2025-08-28T00:00:00Z write a program that generates new boids implementations
2025-08-28T00:00:00Z Repository Guidelines received (see AGENTS.md)
2025-08-28T00:05:00Z Can you please fix this error? ./boids-generator.py Traceback ... NameError: name 'this' is not defined.
2025-08-28T00:08:00Z I forgot to say - I want the simulations to also use a dark theme.
2025-08-28T00:12:00Z can you make another one just like agents/boids-multifile-generator.py but it makes them as single files instead?
2025-08-28T00:15:00Z extend ./boids-singlefile-generator.py to take a --count argument to make multiple simulations
2025-08-28T00:18:00Z I want a lot more variation in the simulations made by ./boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T00:25:00Z add more variation in click effect; add hidden config overlay with all configuration, include min speed, max force, and hue selector; make all configuration URL-overridable; update URL on change.
2025-08-28T00:33:00Z add a lot more variation, slick animations and patterns; ensure config changes apply immediately; polish config overlay; mobile friendly.
2025-08-28T00:40:00Z add perlin-routed drags, lissajous pulses tied to pointer velocity, and meteor strike gravity wells; add --index flag to boids-singlefile-generator.py to build viewer.
2025-08-28T00:45:00Z update singlefile generator <title> to descriptive per-variant title.
