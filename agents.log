2025-08-28T00:00:00Z Repository Guidelines received (see AGENTS.md)
2025-08-28T00:05:00Z Can you please fix this error? ./boids-generator.py Traceback ... NameError: name 'this' is not defined.
2025-08-28T00:08:00Z I forgot to say - I want the simulations to also use a dark theme.
2025-08-28T00:12:00Z can you make another one just like agents/boids-multifile-generator.py but it makes them as single files instead?
2025-08-28T00:15:00Z extend ./boids-singlefile-generator.py to take a --count argument to make multiple simulations
2025-08-28T00:18:00Z I want a lot more variation in the simulations made by ./boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T00:25:00Z add more variation in click effect; add hidden config overlay with all configuration, include min speed, max force, and hue selector; make all configuration URL-overridable; update URL on change.
2025-08-28T00:33:00Z add a lot more variation, slick animations and patterns; ensure config changes apply immediately; polish config overlay; mobile friendly.
2025-08-28T00:40:00Z add perlin-routed drags, lissajous pulses tied to pointer velocity, and meteor strike gravity wells; add --index flag to boids-singlefile-generator.py to build viewer.
2025-08-28T00:45:00Z update singlefile generator <title> to descriptive per-variant title.
2025-08-28T00:50:00Z add a "rainbow" mode to template.html that cycles hue over time with controls and URL params.
2025-08-28T00:55:00Z display frame rate in singlefile simulations generated by agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:00:00Z look at runs/boids-20250827_233042_singlefile/boids-dod-quadtree-30-impl.html  Are there any optimizations you would make?
2025-08-28T01:05:00Z Update agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py with rendering and simulation optimizations (trail alpha via globalAlpha, cached trig, adaptive glow, tmp2 reuse, W/H alias, adaptive vision).
2025-08-28T01:08:00Z add the --index argument to agents/boids-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:10:00Z drift boid colors back toward base hue in agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py
2025-08-28T01:13:00Z add click/drag effects that temporarily affect per-boid alignment/cohesion/separation weights in agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py

==== 2025-08-28T04:18:41Z Prompt Start ====
Let's write a go program (multiple files, templates, etc) where as a command line program it behaves like agents/boids-singlefile-generator.py but it can also be a web server, where /{whatever} is a boids simulation seeded from the value {whatever}
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:25:07Z Prompt Start ====
I want parity with the python program.  Be better than it, if you can.  When serving a page, set the header to {whatever} and leave the subheader empty unless it is explicitly set
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:28:53Z Prompt Start ====
yes.  take as much as you can from the python program.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:52:09Z Prompt Start ====
Let's have the header be stylized a bit, and let's use a monospace font in more places.  Make sure "wrap" works and doesn't lose boids off the screen.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T04:59:44Z Prompt Start ====
yes please. also add a lot more variety to the simulations
==== Prompt End ====

in the simulations generated by the go program, lets have a way to visualize the flow field.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T05:53:48Z Prompt Start ====
Let's add a way to toggle showing the header and subheader. When I click on an icon for an overlay that's already open, I'd like it to close. Add more configuration for the flow fields, including for non-uniform changes in the field. I bet we could make some really interesting patters with the flow fields.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T06:21:16Z Prompt Start ====
Make count slider change boid count live; add perception radius visualization (one/all); per-simulation variety in spawn and click/drag effects; enable flow viz when flow is on; add flow-glow based on nearest arrow; enable quadtree viz by default.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T06:25:47Z Prompt Start ====
Ensure flow fields don't push boids out of bounds or get them stuck; enforce min speed; add boundary attenuation and soft wall repulsion when wrap is off.

Let's add a way to dock the code pane to either the left or the bottom, or to view it maximized.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:20:00Z Prompt Start ====
When the code pane is maximized, let's show two editors side by side and hide the overlay buttons.

When the code pane is docked to the left and minimzied, let's just show an editor icon on the left.  We need to generate an svg of an editor icon with a lofi minimalist style.

add resizable dock width
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:28:00Z Prompt Start ====
let's make the bottom/left/max selector more subtle; it takes up a lot of space right now
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:35:00Z Prompt Start ====
Let's have these selector icons as 3 large icons on the same row as the tabs
==== Prompt End ====

while the code pane is maximized, hide the overlay buttons
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:46:00Z Prompt Start ====
when the code pane is docked left and minimized, hide it completely and add a new temporary overlay button "code" that brings it back.  When the code pane is maximized, make sure that all of the overlay buttons are hidden
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:52:00Z Prompt Start ====
add subtle fade/slide transitions when the code overlay button comes and goes
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T13:58:00Z Prompt Start ====
Update the example code to make it clear to the user what variables are in scope, and the api of the function they are implementing.

Add autocomplete to codemirror.

sometimes when a rule refreshes, the simulation crashes and doesn't recover.  let's add a manual "reset" button with the overlay buttons, and let's try to handle code refreshes more gracefully
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T14:24:00Z Prompt Start ====
Let's show an indicator when we are using fallback code for a rule
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T14:32:00Z Prompt Start ====
When the code pane is maximized, add a way to view two code editors open side by side, each open to a different rule. Add a way to pick which rule to open in each editor. Two editors cannot be open to the same rule.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T14:38:00Z Prompt Start ====
When the code pane is maximized, add an icon next to the "Dock Bottom" icon.  When that icon is pressed, it toggles between one code editor and two.  When there is one code editor, the content is set by the tabs as usual.  When there are two code editors, the tabs are replaced with dropdowns over the editors.

==== 2025-08-28T14:44:00Z Prompt Start ====
what ui polish or layout changes would you suggest for the code editor?
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T14:50:00Z Prompt Start ====
Layout and Density

- Tab row spacing: tighten vertical padding; keep icons right, controls left; ensure wrap on small
screens.
- Code pane header: add subtle shadow and 1px bottom border for separation from editors.
- Editor gutters: slightly darken gutter background; reduce line number gutter width.
- Split divider: add a drag handle between editors for split-on width ratio (40/60 etc.).

==== 2025-08-28T14:56:00Z Prompt Start ====
Is there a better place for the preset selector?

Let's add `alignment`, `cohesion`, `separation`, `novel` to the preset selector.
Let's give all our preset code the same tasteful formatting and documentation that cohesion, separation, alignment, and novel have.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T15:02:00Z Prompt Start ====
Make sure the second pane is visible when in split-pane mode.  Let's update the rule name to the preset whenever we fill with a preset.  Since we are filling with a preset when we first create a new rule, let's just give the new rule the name of the preset (instead of custom). Fix any bugs you find around filling presets and making new rules.
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-28T15:08:00Z Prompt Start ====
can you double check the split pane?  I can only see one code editor
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-29T06:32:12Z Prompt Start ====
In boidlabv1.2.html:
- Write 10 more rules drawn from or inspired by nature.
- Write 10 more rules drawn from or inspired by computer science, machine learning, or artificial intelligence.
- Write 10 more rules drawn from or inspired by physics or math.
- Make sure all these rules are readable, formatted, documented, and well-explained.

==== 2025-08-29T06:50:04Z Prompt Start ====
let's add a lot more visuals.  add them to rules where you think it would help illustrate a concept or look beautiful, and add 20 more rules that just look beautiful to demonstrate how the api works
==== Prompt End ====
==== 2025-08-29T13:02:06Z Prompt Start ====
Add those, please.  Also add an "info" overlay for a highly-technical audience
==== Prompt End ====

yes please, also make the line in the drawable line template a little longer
==== Prompt End ====
in boidlabv1.2.html, let's persist the "include core rules" in the url and let's add a parmeter we can use to load the page with random presets loaded
yes please.  update the help overlay to include all the url parameters
yes please
let's add a graph for the drawables in the stats overlay
add some more flashy presets that create drawables, but don't create them on every frame
yes please. add themed batches.
write some more interesting rules, add some more preset themes, and have some premade bundles of interesting presets you think would go well together.
